Developer Documentation repo for Music Assistant based on MkDocs Material

NOTE that we use a [repo for the main documentation](https://github.com/music-assistant/music-assistant.io) and a [dedicated fork/repo](https://github.com/music-assistant/beta.music-assistant.io) for the beta docs. This contains changes (new features) specific to the MA beta. All the changes made to the beta docs repo will get upstreamed here as soon as the stable release is published.
